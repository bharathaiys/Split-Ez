SPLIT-EZ WEB APP | https://bharathaiys.github.io/SplitApp/

  Splitting bills amongst roommates can be a hassle when one needs to traverse through the items more than one time. This is especially so when different people
  share  different items in the bill. This website lets one split items in a bill appropriately by checking the items any particular member might need. It finally 
  displays the amount each one owes. 
  
DESIGN ASPECT:

  This project also implements the new neumorphism UI design trend. Making each element seem either embossed or debossed to give the interface a 3Dimensional feel.   It is also referred to as Soft UI. Perfecting shadows and highlights was very critical for designing the required effect.
 
HOW TO RUN:
1) Open the link (https://bharathaiys.github.io/SplitApp/)

3) Enter an approximate number of items in the bill.
4) The form will get updated appropriately.
5) One can then enter costs and check appropraite boxes
6) The webiste will then display the split for each person.
